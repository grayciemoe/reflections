How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?-You can address changes in the file incase you are looking for something specific

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? When you are collaborating, it is dependent on an individuals thoughts on a commit and what or when it should be. Pros...not every small detail is highlighted.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is a code repository which means in all dev projects it is more likely than not that files are interrelated

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? Git log gives you a history of commits while git diif using the id's from git log lets you manipulate the same

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? Knowing that I have all my versions available and I can checlout at each version to look at which version made the error and further use diff to know the exact line the error is reporduced from,

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
All projects especially GRC so we can track major changes
